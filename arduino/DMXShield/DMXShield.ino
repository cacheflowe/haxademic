// CTC-DRA-13-1 ISOLATED DMX-RDM SHIELD JUMPER INSTRUCTIONS
//
// If you are using the above mentioned shield you should 
// place the RXEN jumper towards pin number 2, this allows the
// master controller to put to iso shield into transmit 
// (DMX Master) mode 
//
//
// The !EN Jumper should be either placed in the G (GROUND) 
// position to enable the shield circuitry 
//   OR
// if one of the pins is selected the selected pin should be
// set to OUTPUT mode and set to LOGIC LOW in order for the 
// shield to work
//
// The master will control 100 Channels (1-100)
// depending on the ammount of memory you have free you can choose
// to enlarge or schrink the ammount of channels (minimum is 1)
#define DMX_MASTER_CHANNELS   100 

// Pin number to change read or write mode on the shield
#define RXEN_PIN                2

// Configure a DMX master controller, the master controller
// will use the RXEN_PIN to control its write operation 
// on the bus
DMX_Master        dmx_master ( DMX_MASTER_CHANNELS, RXEN_PIN );

int frameCount = 0;

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {             
  // Enable DMX master interface and start transmitting
  dmx_master.enable();
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
  frameCount++;
  for(int i=1; i<30; i++) {
    dmx_master.setChannelValue ( i, 40 + 40 * sin(i + frameCount / 10.) );
