# Set up Windows 10 for installations

* Set up Windows normally during blue setup screens, but: 
  * Don't attach the machine to a network or wifi! Click "I don't have Internet" instead of connecting to Wifi/Ethernet. If you connect, it will force you to create a Microsoft online account
    * Newer Windows installations don't give you this option, so do the following when confronted with internet-only setup
    * Hit `Shift + F10` to launch a cmd prompt
    * Run this command: `OOBE\BYPASSNRO`
    * When it restarts, you should now have an "I don't have Internet" button, followed by a "Continue with a limited setup" button, and can continue setup without a Microsoft account
  * Turn off non-essential services (but keep location services for clock-syncing)

## Disable Windows update notifications
	
* Download [WUB (Windows Update Blocker)](https://www.sordum.org/9470/windows-update-blocker-v1-7/)


## Create ssh key for machines' GitHub access

* Install Git Bash
* Generate a new key in Git Bash terminal:
  ```
  $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your@email.com"
  ```

* Should output:  
  ```
  Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
  Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/your_user/.ssh/id_ed25519):
  Created directory '/c/Users/your_user/.ssh'.
  Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): YOUR_PASSWORD
  Enter same passphrase again: YOUR_PASSWORD
  Your identification has been saved in /c/Users/your_user/.ssh/id_ed25519
  Your public key has been saved in /c/Users/your_user/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
  The key fingerprint is:
  SHA256:j+2JvTnII7o7s8JkXIdH2amW/lF09mrUjR4Uad34nsk your@email.com
  The key's randomart image is:
  +--[ED25519 256]--+
  |       o .    oo |
  |      o o . o.. o|
  |     o o ..o + o+|
  |    o *   . . =oo|
  | . . +  S. . o.o+|
  |  +   . .=  o .E.|
  | +     oooo.     |
  |  o o .o=..o     |
  |   .=B o+.o.     |
  +----[SHA256]-----+
  ```

* Copy to Github project:
  ```
  $ cat /c/Users/your_user/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
  ```
  Shows something like: 
  ```
  $ ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIA6mvfhC48oKJzihaAvZouPr7D1Uhxc4eWSaa5qE8RRU your@email.com
  ```

### Add ssh key to each machine

* Add key to Windows w/Git Bash:
* Copy ssh key files into `C:\Users\your_user\.ssh`
  ```
  $ eval `ssh-agent -s`
  $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
  ```
* Pull repo
  ```
  $ `mkdir ~/Documents/workspace`
  $ `cd ~/Documents/workspace`
  $ `git clone git@github.com:GitHub-Account/github-repo.git`
  $ `cd ~/Documents/workspace/github-repo`
  $ `git pull`
  ```
* Set up your git identity:
```
  $ `git config --global user.email "you@example.com"`
  $ `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
```
* Do git things in Git Bash, and run scripts in CMD
* CMD into project dir to pull, etc
  ```
  $ cd C:\Users\your_user\Documents\workspace\github-repo
  ```

## Make sure your app is using the graphics card

Windows doesn't necesaarily respect NVIDIA settings, when you want to specify that your app should use the dicrete GPU. Go to: 

* (WIN + "Graphics") System -> Display -> Graphics
* Click "Browse" and find your app. If you're using a system Java installation, find the JDK directory, then select `/bin/java` and `/bin/javaw`, and select your high performance graphics card from the menu, and save the setting
